# Fintech Finder

This Streamlit application uses the Ethereum blockchain to provide a client (the user) a list of fintech professionals from which they can choose to hire at an hourly rate.

This project was created for demonstrational purposes only and is not intended to be used with real cryptocurrency.

## How it Works

The application consists of two files, the `fintech_finder.py` file which contains the Streamlit code to run the application, and `crypto_wallet.py` which contains helper functions written in Python.

We of course don't want to use real currency to develop and test an application, so I used the Ganache personal blockchain to create a dummy account for the user. The dummy account is generated with the `generate_account` function in the `crypto_wallet.py` file. To do this, I added the mnemonic seed phrase generated by Ganache to a `.env` file and loaded it into the program. From there I used the bip44 and web3 Python libraries to generate an ethereum wallet and account, as well as public and private keys for the account. 

```python
def generate_account():
    """Create a digital wallet and Ethereum account from a mnemonic seed phrase."""
    # Fetch mnemonic from environment variable.
    mnemonic = os.getenv("MNEMONIC")

    # Create Wallet Object
    wallet = Wallet(mnemonic)

    # Derive Ethereum Private Key
    private, public = wallet.derive_account("eth")

    # Convert private key into an Ethereum account
    account = Account.privateKeyToAccount(private)

    return account
```
The information for the candidates is stored in a database which lists the candidate's name, ethereum account address, Fintech Finder rating, hourly rate, and photo. The starter code for this challenge provided some stock candidates and photos, but I wanted to have some fun so I replaced them with the four lovely individuals listed here.

```python
candidate_database = {
    "Gary": ["Gary", "0xaC8eB8B2ed5C4a0fC41a84Ee4950F417f67029F0", "4.3", .20, "Images/gary_busey.jpg"],
    "Brendon": ["Brendon", "0x2422858F9C4480c2724A309D58Ffd7Ac8bF65396", "5.0", .33, "Images/brendon_urie.jpg"],
    "Yzma": ["Yzma", "0x8fD00f170FDf3772C5ebdCD90bF257316c69BA45", "4.7", .19, "Images/yzma.jpg"],
    "Tom": ["Tom", "0x8fD00f170FDf3772C5ebdCD90bF257316c69BA45", "4.1", .16, "Images/voldemort.jpg"]
}

# A list of the FinTech Finder candidates' first names
people = ["Gary", "Brendon", "Yzma", "Tom"]
```

The `get_people` function loops through the candidates' information and displays it on the webpage.

```python
def get_people(w3):
    """Display the database of Fintech Finders candidate information."""
    db_list = list(candidate_database.values())

    for number in range(len(people)):
        st.image(db_list[number][4], width=200)
        st.write(db_list[number][0])
        st.write("Ethereum Account Address: ", db_list[number][1])
        st.write("FinTech Finder Rating: ", db_list[number][2])
        st.write("Hourly Rate per Ether: ", db_list[number][3], "eth")
        st.text(" \n")
```

The sidebar contains a dropdown menu where the user can select the candidate they would like to hire. Once selected, the candidate's information will be displayed in the sidebar. The user will then type the number of hours for which they would like to hire the candidate into a text box. When the user clicks the "Send Transaction" button, the following code will execute the transaction which will send cryptocurrency from the user's account to the candidate's account.

```python
if st.sidebar.button("Send Transaction"):
    # Call the `send_transaction` function and pass it 3 parameters:
    # Your `account`, the `candidate_address`, and the `wage` as parameters
    # Save the returned transaction hash as a variable named `transaction_hash`
    transaction_hash = send_transaction(w3, account, candidate_address, wage)

    # Markdown for the transaction hash
    st.sidebar.markdown("#### Transaction Complete! Validated Transaction Hash:")

    # Write the returned transaction hash to the screen
    st.sidebar.write(transaction_hash)

    # Celebrate your successful payment
    st.balloons()
```

If the transaction is successful, it will be displayed under the "Transactions" tab in Ganache.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine. To successfully launch and use the application you will need to have the Streamlit library installed. Click [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) for instructions on how to install Streamlit. 

Since the "professionals" listed are obviously not going to provide real technical services, you will also need to create a dummy account. To create a dummy account using Ganache, [install the program](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/), click Quick Start and copy the automatically generated mnemonic seed phrase into a `.env` file located in the same directory as the Fintech Finder files. For example, your `.env` should look like this:

```
MNEMONIC = '<your mnemonic seed phrase>'
```
To launch the application, open your terminal and navigate to the directory containinig the `fintech_finder.py` file and type `streamlit run fintech_finder.py`

This command will launch the app in your browser.
